          <p>This blog post is the second in a series about installing solar panels on our
house. In this post, we'll go over many of the definitions and terms that we
came across, and try to define them in a way that's useful for someone that's
not an electrician or solar installer.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span><h2 id="definitions">Definitions<a class="zola-anchor" href="#definitions" aria-label="Anchor link for: definitions" style="visibility: hidden;"></a>
</h2>
<p>While we were planning our installation, we came across a lot of terms that
and definitions, which we cover here to help you understand the rest of the
series. We assume that you have a basic understanding of electrical terminology
like AC vs. DC, volts, amps, watts, etc.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Solar panels</strong>, sometimes called photovoltaic panels, or PV, are the
components of the system that actually produce power. They have a variety of
properties that are important when designing a system, and we'll cover more
about them in a later post.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Optimizers/rapid shutdown devices</strong> are devices that attach to a solar
panel (or are integrated into the panel) that are used when not using a
microinverter-based system. Per code in Ontario, all solar systems must have
a so-called "rapid shutdown", sometimes abbreviated RSD, that allows the
system to be shut down in case of a fire or other emergency. Some RSDs also
have the ability to optimize the power output at a per-panel level to reduce
the impact of shade. Microinverters will provide rapid shutdown functionality
when those are being used, and thus a separate device is not required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inverter</strong> is the component that converts the DC power produced by the
solar panels (or batteries) into AC power that can be used by your house, or
exported to the rest of the power grid.</p>
<ul>
<li>For inverters that support battery storage, they can typically also
charge the battery by drawing AC power from the grid. These are sometimes
called "inverter-chargers".</li>
<li>There are two major types of inverters in use in residential
installations today: microinverters vs. string inverters. We'll go into
more detail in a later post, but broadly speaking, a microinverter is a
small inverter that attaches to a single solar panel (or sometimes 2/4
panels), while a string inverter is a larger inverter that attaches to
multiple panels that are connected in series in a "string".</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Batteries</strong> are the component(s) that stores power for use later. There are
a variety of battery chemistries in use today, and we'll cover more about
them in a later post. Broadly speaking, though, there are two types of
battery systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>AC-coupled batteries (like the Tesla Powerwall) are connected to other
components of the system and the power grid via an AC connection, and
integrate an inverter-charger into the battery itself.</li>
<li>DC-coupled batteries (similar to a lead-acid or AGM battery that you'd
find in your car) are connected to the rest of the system via a DC
connection, and require a separate inverter to convert the DC power to AC
power and vice-versa. So-called "all-in-one" inverters typically provide
both the DC-AC conversion to connect solar panels and the DC-to-AC or
AC-to-DC conversion for a connected battery.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Balance of system</strong> refers to all the other components of the system that
aren't the solar panels, inverters, or batteries. This includes things like
wiring, fuses, breakers, junction boxes, disconnects, and so on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lamacoids</strong> are the labels that are required to be placed on certain
components of the system, to either provide information about the component
or system (e.g. a copy of the SLD, described below) or to display a warning,
such as "Two Power Sources" or "Rapid Shutdown Switch".</p>
<p>The word "lamacoid" is a trade name; the generic term for these is
"nameplate", "legend plate", or "engraved plate". Typically, they are
required to be weatherproof.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>A <strong>Solar Installer</strong> is the company that installs the solar system. They're
responsible for the design, permitting, installation, and commissioning of
the system. They're also responsible for interfacing with the electrical
utility and the Electrical Safety Authority (ESA) to get the necessary
permits and inspections. They typically also provide a post-installation
warranty and are responsible for any maintenance or troubleshooting that may
be required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Electrical Safety Authority</strong> (ESA) is the organization that is responsible
for electrical safety in Ontario. They must be notified before any work is
done, and will perform inspections and ensure that all electrical work is
done to code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Electrical Utility</strong> is the company that provides power to your house.
They're responsible for the power grid, billing, and are the final arbiter of
whether a solar installation can be connected to the power grid, and how
large of an installation is allowed. Sometimes referred to as the "power
utility", "power company", "hydro company", etc. Here in Ottawa, this is
<a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://hydroottawa.com/">Hydro Ottawa</a>; elsewhere in Ontario it's typically
<a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.hydroone.com/">Hydro One</a>.</p>
<p>The phrase "supply authority" (e.g. as used by the ESA) can refer to the
electrical utility as well, though it's more general than just the utility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <strong>Professional Engineer</strong> (abbreviated P.Eng.) is a person who is licensed
to practice engineering in the province of Ontario. Note that this is
different from someone that has a degree in engineering; a P.Eng. is a person
who has passed the professional engineering exam and has been granted a
license by Professional Engineers Ontario. Certain aspects of the solar
installation must be designed and stamped by a professional engineer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <strong>Master Electrician</strong> is a person who is licensed to perform electrical
work in the province of Ontario, by passing the master electrician exam
administered by the ESA. They are responsible for the installation of the
electrical components of the solar system, and are typically employed by the
solar installer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <strong>Licensed Electrical Contractor</strong> is a company that is allowed to perform
electrical work in the province of Ontario. They employ electricians to
perform the work.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Single-line diagram</strong> (sometimes abbreviated as "SLD") is a diagram that
shows the electrical connections between all the components of the system.
This is a required document for the permit application and interconnection
agreements with the electrical utility, and it's also a useful document to
have when troubleshooting the system.</li>
<li><strong>Permit</strong>, despite being a common term, is a bit of a misnomer in Ontario.
To use the official terminology; you file a "notification of work" with the
Electrical Safety Authority (ESA), where you specify the scope of the work
that you're intending to do. The fees for these notifications are fairly
complicated, but the ESA will walk you through the process on the phone. This
is typically done by the solar installer.</li>
<li><strong>Inspections</strong> are the process whereby an inspector from the ESA will come
out to your house and inspect the work that was done. This is typically
scheduled by the solar installer, and the inspector will check that the work
was done to code and that it's safe. In Ontario, there are two kinds of
inspections:
<ul>
<li><strong>Rough-in inspections</strong> are done before the system is energized, and
checks that the wiring is done correctly, safety requirements are met,
only approved components are used, etc. This inspection must be completed
before the system is energized, and before any of the work completed is
covered up (e.g. by drywall).</li>
<li><strong>Final inspections</strong> are done after the system is completed, and must
performed before the electrical utility will grant permission to connect
to and feed power back to the grid. Upon completion of the final
inspection, the ESA will issue a <strong>Certificate of Inspection</strong> that the
utility will require a copy of.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Connection Authorization</strong> is an approval from the ESA that the system is
safe to connect to the power grid. This is typically required by the
electrical utility before they will allow the system to be connected. The ESA
will issue a "Connection Authorization Verification" certificate.</li>
<li><strong>Distributed Energy Resources</strong>, often abbreviated "DER", is the term used
by the electrical utility to refer to solar systems, battery storage, and
other small-scale power generation systems. In Ontario, if your generation is
a so-called "micro-generation" project, consisting of less than 10kW AC worth
of generation capacity, then typically the utility will perform an
abbreviated review of the system on a relatively short timeline and with
minimal fees.</li>

        <p>The electrical utility cares about the so-called "nameplate capacity" of any
power generation, not what is theoretically possible in a given installation.
So hypothetically, if you install a 20kW inverter, but only 8kW of solar
panels, the utility will consider your system to be 20kW, and you'll be
ineligible for the micro-generation program, even though your system is
incapable of generating more than 8kW of power.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Connection Impact Assessment</strong> (often abbreviated "CIA") is the name of a
form that must be filled out and submitted to the electrical utility. This
form is used by the utility to determine if the proposed solar system will
have any impact on the grid, and if there is capacity to support the proposed
amount of power generation. This form is typically filled out by the solar
installer, and is typically not required for micro-generation projects under
10kW AC of generation capacity.</p>
<p>Another name for this is a "Distribution Connection Impact Assessment"
(abbreviated DCIA).</p>
